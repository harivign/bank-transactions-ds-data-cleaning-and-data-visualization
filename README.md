Bank Transactions Analysis 🏦💡
Welcome to my exploratory project! This repository showcases my journey of analyzing the Bank Transactions Data to extract meaningful insights and enhance my skills in Python, pandas, and machine learning.

📁 Dataset Summary:
The Bank Transactions Data includes records of financial transactions, featuring attributes like transaction amounts, types, dates, and customer details. This dataset provides a rich foundation for exploring trends, behaviors, and patterns in financial activities.

🛠 What I Accomplished:
1️⃣ Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Identified and handled missing values and outliers.
Transformed raw data into a structured format for analysis.
2️⃣ Key Insights:
Analyzed spending patterns across different transaction types (e.g., withdrawals, deposits).
Visualized transaction trends over time to identify peaks and lulls.
Segmented customers based on transaction volume and type.
3️⃣ Predictive Modeling:
Built a classification model to predict transaction types based on user behavior.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
📊 Tools and Techniques:
Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
Visualization: Created intuitive graphs to highlight trends and patterns.
Machine Learning: Developed supervised models for transaction classification.
🚀 Why This Project?
This project serves as a demonstration of my ability to handle real-world data challenges, uncover actionable insights, and build models that could be deployed in a financial services context.
